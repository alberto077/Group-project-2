Project 2: Password Strength Evaluation Program
Objective:
Create a program that assesses password strength based on common security guidelines and
provides users with feedback on improving weak passwords.


functions that:
Count the length of the password and give points for passwords longer
than a specified minimum which is sent to the scoring function

scoring criteria for each factor, so the program can rate the password on a
scale and factor password complexity. Take in the data fromn the analyzer functions and assign the rating

Refrence common password weaknesses, such as short length, repetitive
characters, and the use of common words or sequences (e.g., "password,"
"123456") assign score based on if its close to the common weakness and send to scoring fucntion
